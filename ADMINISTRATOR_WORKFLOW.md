# Administrator Workflow & Decision Tree

## Role Overview
**Administrators** have system-wide access and responsibility. They manage configuration, user accounts, system settings, handle complex escalations, manage audit trails, and ensure system integrity and compliance.

> **📊 AUDIT TRAIL TRACKING NOTE:**  
> All system activities, including administrative actions, are automatically tracked in the comprehensive audit trail. Administrators have complete access to audit reports, activity logs, and system events for compliance, security, and performance monitoring. The audit trail itself is audited (meta-audit) to ensure integrity and accountability.

## Emergency Procedures

### Scenario: User Account Compromised
1. Immediately deactivate user account
2. Force password reset for that user
3. Review audit trail for unauthorized actions
4. Check if any cases were modified
5. Contact user to verify legitimacy
6. If compromised: Check for data exposure
7. Reactivate when secure
8. Document incident

### Scenario: System Under Attack
1. Enable Maintenance Mode immediately
2. All traffic redirected to maintenance page
3. No case submissions possible
4. Existing users can view only (no changes)
5. Investigate security logs
6. Address vulnerability
7. Disable Maintenance Mode when safe
8. Document incident and changes

### Scenario: Database Corruption Detected
1. Stop all system processes
2. Enable Maintenance Mode
3. Run diagnostic: `python manage.py check`
4. Attempt restore from backup
5. If restore succeeds: Verify data integrity
6. If restore fails: Contact technical support
7. Disable Maintenance Mode when safe
8. Review how corruption occurred
9. Implement preventive measures

## Performance Monitoring for Admins

### Key Metrics
- **Database Performance**: Query time, disk usage
- **Application Performance**: Response time, error rate
- **User Activity**: Concurrent users, active sessions
- **Case Processing**: Cases/hour, completion rate
- **System Health**: Memory usage, CPU, storage

### Alerts to Watch For
- ⚠️ Database >85% full
- ⚠️ API response time >1 second
- ⚠️ Error rate >0.1%
- ⚠️ Failed cron jobs
- ⚠️ SSL certificate expiring
- ⚠️ Unusual access patterns

---

## Administrative Support & Escalation

### When to Escalate to External Support
- Database corruption can't be fixed
- Security breach requires forensics
- System outage needs infrastructure support
- Performance issues are hardware-related
- Backup/restore not working
- Disaster recovery needed

### Documentation & Training
- Keep detailed change logs
- Document system configurations
- Train backup admin on procedures
- Create runbooks for common tasks
- Maintain disaster recovery plan

---
