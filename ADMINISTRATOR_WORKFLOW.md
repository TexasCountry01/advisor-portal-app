# Administrator Workflow & Decision Tree

## Role Overview
**Administrators** have system-wide access and responsibility. They manage configuration, user accounts, system settings, handle complex escalations, manage audit trails, and ensure system integrity and compliance.

> **📊 AUDIT TRAIL TRACKING NOTE:**  
> All system activities, including administrative actions, are automatically tracked in the comprehensive audit trail. Administrators have complete access to audit reports, activity logs, and system events for compliance, security, and performance monitoring. The audit trail itself is audited (meta-audit) to ensure integrity and accountability.

## Performance Monitoring for Admins

### Key Metrics
- **Database Performance**: Query time, disk usage
- **Application Performance**: Response time, error rate
- **User Activity**: Concurrent users, active sessions
- **Case Processing**: Cases/hour, completion rate
- **System Health**: Memory usage, CPU, storage

### Alerts to Watch For
- ⚠️ Database >85% full
- ⚠️ API response time >1 second
- ⚠️ Error rate >0.1%
- ⚠️ Failed cron jobs
- ⚠️ SSL certificate expiring
- ⚠️ Unusual access patterns

---

## Administrative Support & Escalation

### When to Escalate to External Support
- Database corruption can't be fixed
- Security breach requires forensics
- System outage needs infrastructure support
- Performance issues are hardware-related
- Backup/restore not working
- Disaster recovery needed

### Documentation & Training
- Keep detailed change logs
- Document system configurations
- Train backup admin on procedures
- Create runbooks for common tasks
- Maintain disaster recovery plan

---

## Email System Administration

### Email Configuration Settings

Administrators control all email functionality through SystemSettings model:

**Setting 1: Enable/Disable Email Notifications**
- **Field:** `enable_delayed_email_notifications`
- **Type:** Boolean (true/false)
- **Purpose:** Master switch for email notification feature
- **Default:** true (enabled)
- **Effect:** When false, no release/hold emails sent

**Setting 2: Email Delay Duration**
- **Field:** `default_email_delay_hours`
- **Type:** Integer (0-24)
- **Purpose:** Hours to delay sending release emails after case completion
- **Default:** 0 (immediate)
- **Examples:** 0=immediate, 1=next hour, 24=next day

**Setting 3: Batch Processing**
- **Field:** `batch_email_enabled`
- **Type:** Boolean (true/false)
- **Purpose:** Enable/disable background email job
- **Default:** true (enabled)

**How to Modify:** Admin Dashboard → System Settings → Email Section → Save

### Email Audit Trail Access

Administrators have full access to all email-related audit entries:

**Finding Email History:**
1. Case Detail → Audit Trail tab
2. Filter by action_type='email_sent', 'email_failed', 'email_notification_sent'
3. View complete email metadata: recipient, subject, timestamp, status

**Email Actions Logged:**
- `email_sent` = Email successfully delivered
- `email_failed` = Email delivery failed
- `email_notification_sent` = Scheduled release email sent
- `notification_created` = In-app notification + email created

### Background Email Job Management

**Command:** `python manage.py send_scheduled_emails`

**How It Works:**
1. Finds all completed cases where scheduled_email_date <= today
2. Checks if actual_email_sent_date IS NULL (not yet sent)
3. Sends email to member
4. Records actual_email_sent_date = NOW
5. Logs action in audit trail

**Running Manually:**
```bash
# Dry run (preview, no emails sent)
python manage.py send_scheduled_emails --dry-run

# Live execution (sends emails)
python manage.py send_scheduled_emails
```

**Cron Job Setup (Recommended):**

Add one of these to your server crontab:

```bash
# Daily at midnight (UTC)
0 0 * * * cd /path/to/advisor-portal-app && python manage.py send_scheduled_emails >> /var/log/emails.log 2>&1

# Or Hourly
0 * * * * cd /path/to/advisor-portal-app && python manage.py send_scheduled_emails >> /var/log/emails.log 2>&1
```

### Email Troubleshooting & Recovery

**Problem: Email Not Received**
1. Check audit trail for `email_failed` entries
2. Verify member email address correct in User profile
3. Check SystemSettings email configuration
4. Run: `python manage.py send_scheduled_emails --dry-run`

**Problem: Scheduled Email Not Sent**
1. Verify case status = 'completed'
2. Check scheduled_email_date is in past or today
3. Verify batch_email_enabled = true in SystemSettings
4. Check if cron job is running

**Recovery Options:**
- Cannot currently resend individual failed emails
- Must manually edit case.actual_email_sent_date = NULL and rerun job
- Or create custom admin command to resend specific emails

### Email Template Management

**Email Templates Location:** `cases/templates/emails/`

**Available Templates:**
- case_on_hold.html / .txt (member hold notification)
- case_released_notification.html / .txt (member release)
- case_rejection_notification.html / .txt (member rejection)
- case_accepted.html (tech assignment)
- case_accepted_member.html (member accepted)
- case_approved_notification.html (QR approved)
- case_revisions_needed_notification.html (QR revisions)
- case_corrections_notification.html (QR corrections)

**Modifying Templates:**
1. Edit .html or .txt file in cases/templates/emails/
2. Changes take effect immediately
3. Variables available: case, member, tech, reason, etc.
4. Keep HTML responsive for mobile

### System Maintenance & Email

**During Maintenance:**
- Set `batch_email_enabled = false` to prevent sending during downtime
- Set `enable_delayed_email_notifications = false` if critical issues
- Restore settings when maintenance complete

### Email Compliance & Audit

**Compliance Features:**
- All emails logged in audit trail
- Timestamps recorded for all send attempts
- Failed emails tracked with error reasons
- Email content archived in audit trail

**Audit Reports:**
- All emails sent to specific member (date range)
- All emails sent on specific date range
- Email delivery failure report
- Email delay compliance report
