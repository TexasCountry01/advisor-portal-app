## Core Manager Actions

Managers oversee technician operations and case workflows:

- **Assign Cases** - Distribute cases to technicians
- **Monitor Performance** - Track metrics, completion times, quality
- **Escalate Issues** - Handle complex cases and exceptions
- **Review Audit Trail** - Track team activity and compliance

---

## Key Manager Actions

### 1. **View Team Dashboard**
- ✓ See all team cases at a glance
- ✓ Case count by status
- ✓ Individual technician workload
- ✓ Performance metrics (case completion, quality)
- ✓ Overdue cases alerts
- ✓ Email notification status for completed cases
- ✓ Monitor case release scheduling

### 2. **Manage Case Assignments**
- ✓ View unassigned cases (queue) with "Review & Accept" needed
- ✓ **Accept & Assign** new cases (or delegate to techs):
  - Review Federal Fact Finder completeness
  - Verify supporting documents
  - Adjust credit value if needed
  - Assign tier (Tier 1, 2, or 3)
  - Select technician
  - ⚠️ System warns if tier > tech level (can override)
- ✓ **Reject/Request More Info** if case incomplete:
  - Select rejection reason
  - Add notes about what's needed
  - Member receives email with requirements
  - Case status → "Needs Resubmission"
- ✓ **Reassign** cases between technicians:
  - Click "Reassign" on accepted case
  - Select new technician
  - Add reason (optional)
  - Audit trail automatically recorded
- ✓ Balance workload across team
- ✓ Assign based on expertise/urgency
- ✓ Verify email notifications are scheduled correctly

### 2A. **Dashboard Status Improvements** (NEW - Jan 2026)
- ✓ **Status badge hover tooltips:**
  - Hover over any status badge to see detailed description
  - Examples:
    - "Submitted" → "Case received and waiting for technician to start"
    - "On Hold" → "Case temporarily paused"
    - "Completed" → "Case completed and released to member" (if actual_release_date set)
    - "Scheduled for Release" → "Completed but scheduled for future release" (if scheduled_release_date set)
  - Helps clarify case state without needing legend
- ✓ **Delayed release system understanding:**
  - Cases with `actual_release_date`: Case is released (member can see reports)
  - Cases with `scheduled_release_date` (no actual_release_date): Awaiting release date
  - If case is completed but neither date set: Still in progress on technician's end
- ✓ **Clean dashboard layout:**
  - Status legend removed (replaced with hover tooltips)
  - Actions column properly populated with View, Edit, Release buttons
  - Column alignment standardized for better readability
  - On-Time/Late metrics visible for completed cases

### 2B. **Column Visibility Management**
### 2C. **Notification System Overview** (NEW)
- ✓ Can view own notification center if notifications exist
- ✓ Can access all case messaging via audit trail
- ✓ Cannot directly view member notifications (member-only access)
- ✓ Can monitor team messaging via case detail pages
- ✓ Can see email notification status on case detail
- ✓ Can respond to member messages (same as technician)
- ℹ️ **Message Notifications:** Instant (no email sent)
- ℹ️ **Case Completion Emails:** Scheduled 0-24 hours (different system)

### 2D. **Customize dashboard view:**

| Quality issue discovered | Don't release, contact tech, request revision |
| Tech performance declining | Pull analytics, schedule 1:1, discuss issues |

---

## Email Notifications & Visibility

### What Emails Managers Receive

**Managers receive NO direct case emails.**

Instead, managers have visibility into email notifications through:
- Case dashboard email status fields
- Audit trail email action logs
- Email delivery monitoring

### Email Status on Dashboard

When viewing cases in dashboard, managers can see email-related information:

| Field | Shows | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Hold Email Status | ✓ Sent / ✗ Failed | Verify member received hold notification |
| Release Email Scheduled | Date scheduled | When member will get release email |
| Release Email Sent | Timestamp | When release email was delivered |
| Email Delivery Status | Success/Failed/Pending | Email delivery confirmation |
| Member Notifications | Unread/Read count | In-app notification status |

### Email Monitoring for Escalations

**When case has issues, check email status:**

| Scenario | Check | Action |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Case put on hold | Audit trail for email_sent | Verify member notified |
| Case completed | Scheduled_email_date | Verify release email scheduled |
| Resubmitted case | Audit trail for email_sent | Verify tech was notified |
| Failed communication | Email_failed in audit trail | Troubleshoot delivery issue |

### Email Tracking Audit Trail

**To view email history for any case:**

1. Navigate to case detail
2. Click "Audit Trail" tab
3. Filter by action_type='email_sent' OR 'email_failed'
4. View: Timestamp, recipient email, email type, delivery status

**Email Actions in Audit Trail:**
- `email_sent` = Email successfully delivered
- `email_failed` = Email delivery failed
- `email_notification_sent` = Scheduled release email sent
- `notification_created` = In-app notification + email created

### Manager's Email Responsibilities

**Managers should monitor emails when:**

1. **Placing case on hold:** Verify member received hold email → Check audit trail
2. **Managing case completion:** Verify release email scheduled → Check dashboard date
3. **Handling resubmissions:** Verify assigned tech received alert → Audit trail check
4. **Escalating to admin:** Use email failures as evidence → Email_failed entries

---
